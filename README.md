# Commonwealth School Project Week Website

The Commonwealth Project Week website is designed to do two things. First, provide a location for people to see and search past projects and project photos. And second, to streamline the process of submitting projects and project reports to be reviewed by advisors and the project week coordinator. The intent is to replace the ill-adapted Google Classroom with a more efficient and intuitive tool for dealing with project week related things.

The original motivation for this project was to continue and expand on Mirai Duintjer Tebbens Nishioka and Amith Saligrama's original project week idea design, which originally included searching for project week data. Since then, the website has expanded on that original concept to include searching, fuzzy searching archives, project submission, project approval by advisors, and an image gallery.
