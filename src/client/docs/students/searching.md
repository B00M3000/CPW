### The Main Collection

![Main Collection](/assets/doc/mainpage.png)

Above is a screenshot of the main project gallery. There are a few components.

1. **Search Bar:** This is used for general searching.

2. **Refine Search Sidebar:** 

   - Filter by Year: allows for filtering by projects between 2 years.

   - Filter by Mentor: allows for searching by specific mentors.

   - Filter by Student: allows for searching by specific students.

   - Filter by Tags: allows for choosing tags to search by.

3. **Learn More Button:** Under each project card is a learn more button, which redirects to the project’s individual page, where the full project description, project report, and project photos can be viewed.

4. **See Archived Button (next to the search bar):** This button redirects to the archived projects page. More information in the section below.

### Archives

The archived projects page displays projects that were done during the years 2018–2019, 2019–2020, and 2022–2023.  This page does not include refined search features, and the projects here do not have full reports, images, or individual pages associated with them.

**This page is fairly basic, but has a few important features:**

1. **Search Bar:** This is a general search bar that can search by name, project subject, mentor, mentor organization, and by category (i.e. computer science, medicine, literature, etc.), using fuzzy searching.

2. **Projects:** Projects are displayed in a table, rather than in card form. The information on display in the table is the only information attached to the project.
