# Project Week Website

The Project Week Website was created to streamline the process of archiving, the project reports review process by advisors, and management for the project week coordinator. The website provides a place to search past projects and project photos for inspiration for subsequent project weeks.

The motivation of this project stemmed from a previous good but unwieldly system in place for Project Week (paper). The inspiration for this project originated from my attendance at a CS meeting run by Mirai Duintjer Tebbens Nishioka '25 in 2022.
